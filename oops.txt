OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System)
Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc.
 Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
  It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation

Inheritance:

When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object,
 it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

Polymorphism:

If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism.

Abstraction:

Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction.

Encapsulation:
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.
 For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
